## **User Stories: Model Saver and Loader**

---

### **1. User Story: Save Models to Registry**

**Title:**
As a **data engineer**, I want to save machine learning models to an MLflow registry, so I can manage model versions and track their progression.

**Description:**
The `Saver` class serves as a base for saving models to the MLflow model registry. The `save` method allows for saving various types of models using either custom or built-in save methods.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `save` method is implemented by subclasses of `Saver` (CustomSaver).
- Supports saving models with their signatures and input examples.
- Provides metadata regarding the saved model through `ModelInfo`.

---

### **2. User Story: Load Models from Registry**

**Title:**
As a **data scientist**, I want to load machine learning models from the MLflow registry, so I can easily make predictions with already registered models.

**Description:**
The `Loader` class serves as a base for loading models from the MLflow model registry. The `load` method allows for loading models which can then be used for inference.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `load` method is implemented by subclasses of `Loader` (CustomLoader).
- Models can be loaded using a unique URI, providing flexibility in model retrieval.

---

### **Common Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Implementation Requirements:**
   - The `Saver` and `Loader` base classes cannot be instantiated directly.
   - Subclass implementations (CustomSaver, CustomLoader) must clearly define `save` and `load` methods, respectively.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Appropriate errors are raised for failed save or load operations, including invalid model URIs and unsupported formats.

3. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests validate the correct implementation of save and load methods for all subclasses.
   - Tests cover both the handling of valid and invalid model URIs and serialization formats.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Each class and method has clear, instructive docstrings.
   - Examples illustrate common use cases for saving and loading models.

---

### **Definition of Done (DoD):**

- The `Saver` and `Loader` classes and all required methods are implemented with clear documentation.
- Subclasses (CustomSaver, CustomLoader) are tested for saving and loading various models.
- Code adheres to the project's coding standards and passes peer review.
- Unit tests have a wide coverage of scenarios and edge cases.

## **User Stories: Custom and Built-in Savers**

---

### **1. User Story: Saving Custom Models**

**Title:**
As a **machine learning engineer**, I want to save my custom models using the MLflow PyFunc module so that I can leverage MLflow's tracking and deployment features.

**Description:**
The `CustomSaver` class extends the `Saver` base class and implements the logic to save custom models that conform to the MLflow PyFunc flavor.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Custom models can be saved using the `save` method from the `CustomSaver` class.
- The saved model must retain its signature and input/output examples for later use.

---

### **2. User Story: Using LiteLLM-compatible Client to Initialize CustomSaver Adapter**

**Title:**
As a **machine learning engineer**, I want to use LiteLLM-compatible client for  `CustomSaver` Adapter, so I can leverage the features provided and easy deployment via the client .

**Description:**
The  `__init__` on  `CustomSaver.Adapter`  should have the functionality  to setup a `LiteLLM`-compatible client ( `OpenAIChatCompletionClient` ) based on the provided configurations .

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The  `__init__`  initializes a LiteLLM-compatible client in `CustomSaver.Adapter`.
- The config contains the fields model,api_key,base_url, temeperature and max_tokens.

---

### **3. User Story: Load Configurations from JSON file**

**Title:**
As a **machine learning engineer**, I want to load the model´s config from a specified path and use it later to load the model in the `CustomSaver.Adapter`class.

**Description:**
The  `load_context`  on `CustomSaver.Adapter` should load the context information from a json file and use it to initiate a new model

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The load from the `config_file` property should be implemented correctly
- If a  configuration is not provided should raise the exception Value Error
- If a file doesn´t exists should raise the exception FileNotFoundError

---

### **4. User Story: Define prediction  method**

**Title:**
As a **machine learning engineer**, I want to define a method to  predict and validate the `CustomeSaver` model for a  `fastAPI` enpoint.

**Description:**
The   `predict` method, should use the method already implemented and the response should follow the data Schema of the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The predict method should be implemented correctly
- The output  should be a valid `schemas.Outputs` object, containing both the prediction and metadata.
- If something fails, the method should use the  method of the model to try and infer otherwise the exception is handled

---

### **Common Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Implementation Requirements:**
   - The `CustomSaver` class extends the `Saver` base class and implements required methods.
   - All necessary parameters for saving models are correctly handled.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The `save` method raises informative errors for issues such as unprocessable model types or incorrect input schemas.

3. **Testing:**
   - Unit tests verify successful model saving and correct handling of error scenarios.

4. **Documentation:**
   - Clear docstrings and usage examples for the `CustomSaver` class and associated `Adapter`.

---

### **Definition of Done (DoD):**

- The `CustomSaver` class is implemented and adheres to the design principles.
- The `save` method in `CustomSaver` successfully serializes and saves models.
- All functionality is tested with unit tests, including error scenarios.
- Documentation is complete, with clear instructions for usage and extensibility.

## **User Stories: Custom Loaders**

---

### **1. User Story: Loading Custom Models**

**Title:**
As a **data scientist**, I want to load custom models from the MLflow registry so that I can run inference on my custom ML models when needed.

**Description:**
The `CustomLoader` class is responsible for retrieving custom models stored in the MLflow registry and providing them for prediction purposes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `load` method retrieves the model and returns it wrapped in an adapter for inference.
- Supports flexible model input as per the defined schema.

---

### **2. User Story: Adapt Custom Loaders**

**Title:**
As a **Developer** ,I need to create a Custom adapter to load the context and  predict the model, so the fastAPI can make request to the model.

**Description:**
The `Adapter` allows to adapt load the configurations and predict

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `load_context`method must be created.
- The `predict`method must return a `schemas.Outputs` objects.

---

### **Common Acceptance Criteria**

1. **Implementation Requirements:**
