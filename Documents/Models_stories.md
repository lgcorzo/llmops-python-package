## **User Story: Develop a Base Model Class for Machine Learning Frameworks**

---

**Title:**  
As a **machine learning engineer**, I want a **base `Model` class** to standardize the implementation of machine learning models, so that I can easily integrate different frameworks and ensure a consistent interface across the project.

---

**Description:**  
The `Model` class serves as an abstract base class for all machine learning models in the project. It defines a set of essential methods and attributes required for training, predicting, and explaining models. By implementing this base class, users can create custom models that adhere to the project's standards and integrate seamlessly into the pipeline.

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

1. **Attributes**  
   - Define the `KIND` attribute to identify the type of model being implemented.  
   - Ensure `KIND` is unique for each subclass of the `Model` class.  

2. **Parameter Management**  
   - **Get Parameters:**  
     - Implement the `get_params` method to retrieve all model parameters.  
     - Exclude private (`_`) and uppercase attributes from the parameters list.  
   - **Set Parameters:**  
     - Implement the `set_params` method to update the model's parameters dynamically.  
     - Ensure that parameter updates are applied in place and return the updated model instance.  

3. **Core Methods**  
   - Define the following abstract methods:  
     - `fit(inputs: schemas.Inputs, targets: schemas.Targets)`  
       - Train the model on provided inputs and targets.  
       - Return the fitted model instance.  
     - `predict(inputs: schemas.Inputs)`  
       - Generate predictions using the trained model.  
       - Return outputs in the `schemas.Outputs` format.  

4. **Model Explainability**  
   - **Global Explainability:**  
     - Provide an `explain_model` method to return feature importances.  
     - Raise a `NotImplementedError` if not overridden by the subclass.  
   - **Local Explainability:**  
     - Provide an `explain_samples` method to return SHAP values for individual samples.  
     - Raise a `NotImplementedError` if not overridden by the subclass.  

5. **Internal Model Access**  
   - Implement the `get_internal_model` method to expose the internal model object (e.g., a scikit-learn or TensorFlow model).  
   - Raise a `NotImplementedError` if the method is not overridden by the subclass.  

6. **Validation and Enforcement**  
   - Use `pydantic.BaseModel` to enforce strict validation of model attributes and parameters.  
   - Set `strict=True`, `frozen=False`, and `extra="forbid"` to ensure data consistency while allowing parameter updates.  

7. **Testing**  
   - Validate the following scenarios:  
     - Successful instantiation of model subclasses.  
     - Proper parameter retrieval and updates using `get_params` and `set_params`.  
     - Enforcement of abstract method implementation in subclasses.  
   - Write unit tests for all methods, ensuring they behave as expected.

---

**Definition of Done (DoD):**  
- The `Model` class is implemented with all specified methods and attributes.  
- Abstract methods enforce implementation in derived classes.  
- Subclass compatibility is verified with unit tests.  
- The class is well-documented, including detailed examples of usage.  
- The code passes all CI/CD validation checks and integrates seamlessly with existing project modules.
  

## User Story: Develop a Baseline Autogen chatgroup for LLM

---

**Title:**  
As a **data scientist**, I want a reusable baseline model implementation using [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dev//index.html), so that I can easily benchmark advanced models and understand the  performance of chatgroup of LLM models.

---

**Description:**  
The `BaselineAutogenWorkflow` class provides a baseline chatgroup using  LLM leveraging autogen  `UserProxyAgent & AssistantAgent` wrapped in a agents workflow. This class is designed to be easily integrated into the project, with capabilities for predicting, and model explainability. It supports automated handling of prompts up to 128000 tokens features and provides SHAP-based feature  explanations for LLM

---

**Acceptance Criteria:**  

1. **workflow Parameters**  
   - Define the following configurable parameters for the model:  
     - `max_tokens` (default: 128000):limit of the maximun token that can be used by the model   

2. **Feature Handling**  
   - **prompt Features:**  
     - String input as query ensuring the maximun length of the prompt

3. **workflow Construction**  
   - Combine agents  to  process and execute tasks defined.  


5. **Prediction**  
   - Implement the `predict` method to generate predictions using the agent workflow
   - Output predictions in the defined `schemas.Outputs` format.

6. **Model Explainability**  
   - **Global Explainability:**  
     - Provide feature importance scores using the `explain_model` method.  
     - Map feature importance to transformed feature names for clear interpretation.  
   - **Local Explainability:**  
     - Implement the `explain_samples` method to provide SHAP for LLM values for specific input samples.  


7. **Error Handling**  
   - Raise appropriate errors when attempting to use the model before training (`ValueError`).  

8. **Validation and Testing**  
   - Validate the following scenarios:  
     - Training the model with valid inputs and targets.  
     - Generating predictions from trained models.  
     - Explaining model structure and predictions.  https://medium.com/@davidacad10/using-llms-for-shap-explanation-f106da74dd75
   - Write unit tests to ensure correct implementation of each method.  

---

**Definition of Done (DoD):**  
- All methods (predict`, `explain_model`, `explain_samples`, `get_internal_model) are implemented and tested.  
- Documentation provides clear examples for model usage, training, prediction, and explanation.  
- Code is integrated into the project and passes all CI/CD checks.  
- SHAP-based explanations are verified for consistency with transformed features.  
- Model outputs conform to `schemas.Outputs` and are reproducible with a fixed `random_state`.
